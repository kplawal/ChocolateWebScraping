# ChocolateWebScraping
I have found a website that has over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from all around the world. It’s displayed in the web browser.
The data is displayed in a table, instead of in a csv or json. Thankfully, I will be exercising the power of BeautifulSoup that will help me transform
this webpage into a DataFrame so I can manipulate and analyze.
The rating scale is from 1-5. A 1 is “unpleasant” chocolate, while a 5 is a bar that transcends “beyond the ordinary limits”.

Some questions i thought about when I found this dataset were: Where are the best cocoa beans grown? 
Which countries produce the highest-rated bars? What’s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?

I want to find a way I can answer these questions, or uncover more questions, using BeautifulSoup and Pandas?
